# Booki

**Hello,**

That's it, Loïc has finalized the desktop, tablet and mobile mockups of the site! You will be able to integrate them. They are available as attachments on Figma. Don't forget to connect to Figma to see all the information about the elements of the model.

You will also find in attachment the folder containing all the images to use on the site.

In order to make the project very clear, Loïc and I have prepared a summary of the specifications and technical constraints to be respected (see attachment).

In order for us to be able to consult the site once it's finished, you'll have to version your whole project with Git and give us the link to the project accessible on GitHub with :
- an "index.html" file containing all the **HTML code** of the project;
- a "CSS" folder with a "style.css" file containing all the **CSS code** of the project;
- an **"images" folder** containing all the images used.

Good luck with this project, and have a nice day!
